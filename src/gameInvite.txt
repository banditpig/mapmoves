Hello,

You have been invited to a 'hidden moves' game session.

Please do not change the subject in this email. It is updated after each turn and is needed to keep track of turns.

The way it works is that each player sends an email with their moves. When both players have replied with their 
moves for the current turn the system determines if any moves end in the same location.

A move is written as
(1,1) -> (2,2);

this means whatever is in location 1,1 moves to location 2,2

The (, ), -> , and ; are important but spaces can occur wherever convenient.
eg (1,2) -> (2,2)  is the same as  (1, 1 )  ->  (  2, 2 );

The email must have the list of moves contained between the words 'move' and 'end' (without the enclosing '').

eg


move

(1,1)->  (2,1);
(2,1) ->  (3,1);
(11,3) -> (2,1);
(1,1)->  (2,1);
(2,1) ->  (27,1);

end

Is valid and anything before 'move' and after 'end' is ignored.
Please be sure to write 'move' and not 'Move' or 'mOVe'.  All lower case please.

On the first turn you forces have not been deployed so the firs location will be (0,0) - the location (0,0) is 'special'
in that it is not part of the map. 

An example of a first move is



move
 (0,0) -> (1,2);
 (0,0) -> (2,2);

end

and the next turn could be 

move
  (1,2) -> (4,4);
  (2,2) -> (3,2);

end

Notice that the end points of the first turn are the start points of the second turn.

If at any point you wish to quit playing then just send the turn email with just the word 'quit' in the body.
